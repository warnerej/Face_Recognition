# Face_Recognition

Hello Welcome to my Facial Recognition Project!

This was a smaller project I wanted to try and do just to get an idea of how to use openCV in hopes of being able to read faces. The goal is to get a better understanding of code like this so I can use it in real world projects like a smart mirror that will identify who is present using facial recognition software. Hopefully you were able to learn something from this code as well with the amount of comments I have added to try and walk myself and others through what was being done!
